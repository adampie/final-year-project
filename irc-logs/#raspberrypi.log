Oct 22 19:55:10 <spechter>	hello everyone, i want to automount a davfs2 filesystem on my stock rpi2. mounting manually works flawlessly with the credentials beeing stored in /etc/davfs2/secrets and the server certificate in /etc/davfs2/certsxyz.pem. when mounting the filesystem manually it mounts it just fine without asking for credentials or complaining about a missmatching certificate, but it won't mount it automatically on
Oct 22 19:55:16 <spechter>	boot. journalctl doesn't provide any information of an unsuccessfull try and i whonder where i might find some usefulls logs to figure out why it fails

Oct 23 08:06:35 <jaggz>	channel I've tried.. etc.
Oct 23 08:06:53 <jaggz>	after changing the transmission rate, then I could connect (and get an IP)
Oct 23 08:07:23 <SirLagz>	jaggz: did you try rebooting the router earlier?
Oct 23 08:08:01 <jaggz>	yeah
Oct 23 08:08:57 <jaggz>	I thought all these settings I'd done a longer time ago (been using the rpi since).. but I guess I fixated the trnamission rate setting more recently :/
Oct 23 08:09:24 <jaggz>	I wonder why the dhcp takes several attempts to get an ip
Oct 23 08:11:41 <jaggz>	 2; ifup wlan0; }
Oct 23 08:11:47 <jaggz>	oops
Oct 23 08:11:56 <jaggz>	 /sbin/ifconfig wlan0 | /bin/grep -q inet.addr || { echo Resetting wlan0; ifdown wlan0; sleep 2; ifup wlan0; }
Oct 23 08:12:01 <jaggz>	I have that in my cron
Oct 23 08:12:16 <jaggz>	(not related to the dhcp delay)
Oct 23 08:12:32 <jaggz>	just so my rpi will retry a connection if it sees the interface down
Oct 23 08:12:42 <jaggz>	not sure if that's the most reliable check (for an ip in ifconfig output)
Oct 23 08:13:28 <SirLagz>	jaggz: eh, I had something similiar for my Pi
Oct 23 08:14:09 <jaggz>	why eh?
Oct 23 08:14:13 <jaggz>	did you switch to something better?
Oct 23 08:14:20 <jaggz>	someone mentioned wicd-console or something
Oct 23 08:14:21 <SirLagz>	jaggz: I'm trying to remember what I had lol
Oct 23 08:14:26 <jaggz>	now that my network's working I can install stuff :)
Oct 23 08:14:37 <SirLagz>	jaggz: nope, I had pretty much exactly what you had lol
Oct 23 08:14:49 <jaggz>	heh
Oct 23 08:15:38 *	SirLagz wonders if he can play Diablo 1 on his Pi
Oct 23 08:16:56 <jaggz>	:)
Oct 23 08:19:09 *	jaggz wonders what his password was for his livingroom pi
Oct 23 08:19:17 <jaggz>	this one I have hooked up as an audio reminder system
Oct 23 08:19:32 <jaggz>	runs to a mixer on which we have our two computers as well
Oct 23 08:19:48 <jaggz>	mp3's in crontab :)
Oct 23 08:19:51 <SirLagz>	It's been a while since I've played with my Pis
Oct 23 08:20:05 <SirLagz>	should really get back into it
Oct 23 08:20:06 <jaggz>	got it.. yay
Oct 23 08:21:09 <SirLagz>	jaggz: you should make your sprinker system Pi broadcast an AP if it can't connect to your home network, then at least you can still control it :D
Oct 23 08:22:34 <SirLagz>	hmm I wonder what the Pixel desktop is based on
Oct 23 08:25:27 <Sonny_Jim>	Erm it's
Oct 23 08:25:32 <Sonny_Jim>	XFCE I think
Oct 23 08:26:54 <SirLagz>	that would mean I would need to install XFCE too then
Oct 23 08:27:32 <SirLagz>	Sonny_Jim: looks like it's LXDE actually
Oct 23 08:28:07 <Sonny_Jim>	Ah yeah, I knew it was one of the 4 letter ones ;)
Oct 23 08:28:36 <SirLagz>	Sonny_Jim: just going by the comments from the pixel intro blog post on the rpi.org blog
Oct 23 08:28:52 <jaggz>	SirLagz, wait what?
Oct 23 08:28:58 <jaggz>	broadcast an IP?
Oct 23 08:29:05 <jaggz>	meaning it acts as an access point?
Oct 23 08:29:18 <SirLagz>	jaggz: yeah
Oct 23 08:29:24 <jaggz>	never done that :)
Oct 23 08:29:47 <SirLagz>	jaggz: I did that for a while
Oct 23 08:29:49 <jaggz>	I just put this on it though: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045IIZKU
Oct 23 08:30:57 <jaggz>	(note: That doesn't come with a power supply)
Oct 23 08:31:31 <jaggz>	thankfully the 3rd wallwart I picked up was 12v 1a, center positive, with the proper sized connector
Oct 23 08:32:08 <SirLagz>	jaggz: lol
Oct 23 08:32:22 <SirLagz>	I haven't done the self-broadcasting AP in a while though, might have to try it out with updated stuff to make sure it still works
Oct 23 08:33:09 <jaggz>	(for audio reminders, I find a youtube video with a suitable phrase in it, capture it with audacity and save myself an mp3)

Oct 24 10:54:32 <Drzacek>	anywhere near western germany??
Oct 24 10:56:00 <Drzacek>	hmmm over the sea, not gonna make it
Oct 24 10:57:00 <thearduinoguy>	Nah Finland is one of our closest neighbours.
Oct 24 10:57:24 <thearduinoguy>	So is France.
Oct 24 10:57:31 <thearduinoguy>	You could easily pop over ;)

Oct 24 11:01:27 <Drzacek>	I'll just get strawberry jam and stay home
Oct 24 11:06:28 <jamesaxl>	for controlling 4 DC motors, should I use 2 L293D or just one ? or something better?
Oct 24 11:18:36 <pksato>	jamesaxl: you need rotation inversion?
Oct 24 11:19:15 <Lonefish>	http://imgur.com/a/ZI8wy That's... different..
Oct 24 11:20:57 <Drzacek>	will the next version be 0.8?

Oct 24 12:18:52 <jamesaxl>	pksato, yep
Oct 24 12:19:09 <jamesaxl>	I  you need rotation inversion
Oct 24 12:22:15 <pksato>	jamesaxl: you need two L293D.
Oct 24 12:25:19 <jamesaxl>	pksato, I think for drone with 4 brushful motors, they use also two  L293D
Oct 24 12:32:21 <RoBo_V>	i want to configure rpi as wireless ap and wifi client at same time, do i have to look for speicifc wifi dongle.
Oct 24 12:34:31 <Armand>	RoBo_V: I believe you'd need two adapters..
Oct 24 12:34:56 <RoBo_V>	Armand: im planning on using one and do routing.
Oct 24 12:35:12 <Armand>	Yeah, it's doable.. like a bridge mode..
Oct 24 12:35:17 <Armand>	But, I have no idea how. :P
Oct 24 12:36:08 <RoBo_V>	because as I read they say there are only some wifi chips that actually support virtual interface.
Oct 24 12:38:56 <Drzacek>	now who is this peer guy and why is he resetting my connections! :[
Oct 24 12:39:51 <Armand>	He's Santa.. and he does it because you touch yourself at night
Oct 24 12:40:13 <binaryhermit-chi>	that's not really appropriate :P (not that I care)
Oct 24 12:40:24 <Armand>	Couldn't be helped. :P
Oct 24 12:40:37 <Armand>	I'll keep it as PG as I can though.. lol
Oct 24 12:41:00 <binaryhermit-chi>	lol
Oct 24 12:44:06 <SirLagz>	RoBo_V: find one that does 2.4ghz and 5ghz and use one for ap and one for client
Oct 24 12:45:04 <RoBo_V>	SirLagz: if i use 2.4ghz only, bandwidth gets half. Thats it right ?
Oct 24 12:45:28 <SirLagz>	RoBo_V: depends on the wifi adapter. I haven't found one that will do AP and client both on the 2.4ghz band

Oct 24 13:35:21 <DWKnight>	and with the pi, you very quickly hit USB root hub bandwidth limits if you use one that is both compatible with the pi and capable of that function

Oct 24 15:00:49 <oneirosFade>	Isn't Pixel just LXDE though?
Oct 24 15:00:57 <SirLagz>	oneirosFade: LXDE with some modifications
Oct 24 15:01:03 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: you're missing a package there :P
Oct 24 15:01:05 <shiftplusone>	oneirosFade: LXDE with lots of patches and a custom theme.
Oct 24 15:01:17 <shiftplusone>	SirLagz: what am I missing?
Oct 24 15:01:18 <oneirosFade>	Hm...
Oct 24 15:02:31 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: raspberry-ui-mods
Oct 24 15:02:34 <SirLagz>	oh wait
Oct 24 15:02:43 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: lxde I meant lol
Oct 24 15:02:51 <shiftplusone>	lxde will be pulled in
Oct 24 15:02:56 <SirLagz>	ah
Oct 24 15:02:57 <shiftplusone>	the parts of it which are needed anyway
Oct 24 15:03:08 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: I must have done something odd then before.
Oct 24 15:03:22 <shiftplusone>	the --no-install-recommends is to avoid installing 100 things that aren't really needed.
Oct 24 15:03:25 <SirLagz>	heh
Oct 24 15:03:55 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: I've installed Pixel and set the right things but looks like it's still missing a few settings before it really *becomes* pixel
Oct 24 15:04:07 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: stuff like panel configs n stuff apparently
Oct 24 15:04:48 <shiftplusone>	if you stop lightdm, go in and remove the old files in .config, it will be replaced when you restart lightdm
Oct 24 15:04:49 <hue>	What is /var/backups/alternatives.tar.0 and why is it filling up my sd card every day
Oct 24 15:05:12 <shiftplusone>	you can look at startlxde-pi to see which file to delete.
Oct 24 15:06:02 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: I might start from scratch and see if doing it from scratch gets Pixel into the same state as if I downloaded the Pixel Raspbian
Oct 24 15:06:20 <shiftplusone>	SirLagz: I've been working on making sure that it does.
Oct 24 15:06:58 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: ah nice...are you one of the magical Pi workers now?
Oct 24 15:08:18 <shiftplusone>	yes, I break things and get complained at full time here. That was why I came to UK in the first place.
Oct 24 15:08:39 <SirLagz>	shiftplusone: oohhhh....can I PM you?

Oct 24 15:17:55 <RoBo_V>	Voop: I see, so you created two wlans in intefaces one for AP (hostapd) and other as client (wpa_supplicant)

Oct 24 15:25:44 <Armand>	oneirosFade: No.
Oct 24 15:25:52 <Voop>	since its doing both at once, its divided in half

Oct 24 15:26:17 <Armand>	Thing is, oneirosFade.. is that ops can command ChanServ to do things anyway.

Oct 24 17:56:06 <RoBo_V>	lol i have configure mail on pi and now it sending me every cron job mail, thats strange!
Oct 24 17:56:33 <adampie>	Can someone explain what this does? -> debconf-set-selections <<SELEOF
Oct 24 17:56:33 <adampie>	`cat ${i}-debconf`
Oct 24 17:56:33 <adampie>	SELEOF
Oct 24 17:56:47 <RoBo_V>	I think it is reading pi@raspberrypi as mail to send to.
Oct 24 17:57:27 <shiftplusone>	adampie: pi-gen stuff ey?
Oct 24 17:57:35 <pwillard>	RoBo_V: its probably scripted.
Oct 24 17:57:35 <shiftplusone>	It's pre-seeding answers to debconf questions
Oct 24 17:57:54 <adampie>	Yep. working on something for my final year project at uni
Oct 24 17:58:17 <shiftplusone>	adampie: are you the one porting it to use... some other thing I forget the name of?
Oct 24 17:58:28 <adampie>	Ansible yeah
Oct 24 17:58:28 <shiftplusone>	ansible comes to mind
Oct 24 17:58:51 <RoBo_V>	pwillard: no, mail command is not there in cron script.
Oct 24 17:58:57 <shiftplusone>	Ah okay, I had an email about it from your supervisor... cool. Let me know if you have any questions. I am the one responsible for the mess that is pi-gen.
Oct 24 17:59:16 <pwillard>		(>ლ)   School assignments

Oct 24 18:04:08 <RoBo_V>	How can I prevent every cron mail but to mail only when asked.
Oct 24 18:04:14 <mfa298>	RoBo_V: cron will email any standard out of things it runs by default. Previously is was probably just saving them locally (likely in /var/spool/mail/pi)
Oct 24 18:05:45 <mfa298>	RoBo_V: best option is fix your scripts in cron to not have output when run norally (then you can get emails only if they break and put something n stdout)

Oct 24 18:08:16 <mfa298>	Voop: for tx and rx I've got a HackRF although not done a huge amount with it. Obviously you need suitable licenses for transmitting (or know what's legal in the license exempt bands)
Oct 24 18:08:31 <shiftplusone>	adampie: raspberrypi-ui-mods has a change to set libgksu-gconf-defaults, but that fails if libgksu is not installed

Oct 24 18:10:22 *	vdamewood (~vdamewood@unaffiliated/vdamewood) has joined
Oct 24 18:10:26 <shiftplusone>	if you use qcow and branch each stage instead, it will be much faster
Oct 24 18:10:30 <mfa298>	I think all the tx capable SDRs are of a reasonable size (also look at LimeSDR, BladeRF and USRP) - althoguh I think they all also cost more than the HackRF
Oct 24 18:10:46 <shiftplusone>	otherwise, most of the bottleneck is installing the packages, which won't be any faster
Oct 24 18:11:36 <shiftplusone>	You can take a look at spindle to see how it's done with qcow images and how to convert the final qcow image into a raw image.
Oct 24 18:12:15 <shiftplusone>	I didn't like fiddling with qcow images, so I dropped that. Might be useful to add it back as an option one day.
Oct 24 18:13:09 <adampie>	I was actually thinking depending on what final build you want it would get all the packages at once and do other config stuff simultaneously as it's a feature of ansible. Just need to fully understand what's happening and what can happen at the same time.

Oct 24 18:49:06 <shiftplusone>	don't know the stage 1 size off the top of my head
Oct 24 18:49:10 <ali1234>	is it built in qemu then?
Oct 24 18:49:21 <shiftplusone>	qemu-user chroot
Oct 24 18:49:34 <ali1234>	fun...
Oct 24 18:49:42 <ali1234>	pi-gen looks real similar to debirf

Oct 24 18:50:18 <ali1234>	my problem at the moment is i have to do a lot of building on th epi
Oct 24 18:50:28 <shiftplusone>	It's also similar to live-boot.... you kind of end up with similar things when there are common design goals.
Oct 24 18:50:33 <ali1234>	which takes forever, mainly because SD cards are slow

Oct 24 18:51:15 <shiftplusone>	look into getting a samsung chromebook
Oct 24 18:51:33 <ali1234>	i have a samsung chromebox somewhere but it's x86
Oct 24 18:52:12 <shiftplusone>	yeah, I meant the arm one. I use it to build things like chromium, libreoffice and whatever else takes a week on the pi and then crashes while linking because there is not enough ram
Oct 24 18:52:28 <ali1234>	i've managed to get everything i need cross compiling
Oct 24 18:52:36 <shiftplusone>	ah okay
Oct 24 18:52:37 <ali1234>	the slow point is now building the image
Oct 24 18:52:51 <ali1234>	running debootstrap takes about 10 minutes

Oct 24 18:54:34 <shiftplusone>	I use apt-cacher-ng and local mirrors for the packages, but that's not really for speed but to be able to build if raspbian.org goes down.
Oct 24 18:54:51 <ali1234>	it's a big speed increase for me cos my internet sucks

Oct 24 18:56:25 <shiftplusone>	comparing apples and oranges here though
Oct 24 18:56:31 <ali1234>	my image is probably a lot simpler than yours of course
Oct 24 18:56:34 <shiftplusone>	yeah
Oct 24 18:56:44 <ali1234>	it's literally a debootstrap and about 10 packages
Oct 24 18:57:25 <ali1234>	however, about 10 minutes of that is the debootstrap and about another 10 minutes is gzipping the final image, which is about 250MB uncompressed
Oct 24 18:58:09 <shiftplusone>	pigz is a good alternative to gzip
Oct 24 18:58:10 <ali1234>	the trouble is that debirf uses fakeroot which doesn't cooperate with qemu and various other cross-arch techniques
Oct 24 18:58:15 <shiftplusone>	archive in parallel
Oct 24 18:58:20 <ali1234>	i've actually switched to lzop
Oct 24 18:58:27 <shiftplusone>	ah
Oct 24 18:58:34 <DWKnight>	anything that can do multithreaded compression will probably help
Oct 24 18:58:49 <DWKnight>	although you hit a ceiling on what your hardware is able to handle
Oct 24 18:58:52 <ali1234>	it's faster than pigz even though it,s single threaded, and it uncompresses over twice as fast too
Oct 24 18:58:57 <adampie>	How does apt-get compare to apt-fast?
Oct 24 18:59:14 <ali1234>	it's 10% larger but it decreased my boottime from ~35 seconds to ~15 seconds
Oct 24 18:59:21 <shiftplusone>	apt-fast only downloads in parallel, doesn't it?

Oct 24 19:00:30 <ali1234>	i'd guess that's highly unlikely to ever happen
Oct 24 19:01:12 <ali1234>	oh btw thanks for fixing the kernel dependency thing
Oct 24 19:01:25 <shiftplusone>	no worries, sorry it took so long
Oct 24 19:01:39 <ali1234>	i won't need to build a fake package with equivs any more, should save a few seconds on the build and a couple kb in the image :)
Oct 24 19:01:45 <shiftplusone>	wanted to be sure I understood the consequences before doing something that could leave people without a kernel
Oct 24 19:02:28 <shiftplusone>	luckily apt auto-remove only suggests stuff for removal if it's not in recommends of an already installed package.
